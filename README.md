Libraries need installed - (you will likely have some errors for pycaret)

conda install pandas

conda install geopandas

conda install matplotlib

conda install unidecode

conda install plotly

conda install pycaret

Have the ml, data_visualization and main in one file. Add a frames folder to the file.
Run the code using main. Then in terminal: ffmpeg -framerate 5 -i /home/frame_%03d.png output.mp4.
You may also have to install ffmpeg in the folder. If the data_visualization part of the code is run using ed, no installations are required.
If this is done on visual studio - install ffmpeg, use a 7z unzipper, and specify the bin folder for the terminal call.

Download link for ffmpeg for windows -

Replace all paths to path in computer including the terminal call.
